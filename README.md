# Learn Disparity Space from Light Field via a Query Mechanism

# intro: 
Learn not only a 2D disaprity map, but also a 2.5D disparity space from  Light Field
1. Three Networks for light field images encoding,  based on a Query Mechanism: EPI-Patch(Query), EPI-Volume(Query), Cost-Volume(Query)
2. A hybrid sampling strategy: unifrom sampling, gaussian sampling, iterative sampling.
3. A decoder conditioned on a query module for the 2.5D space learning.
4. Three generation algorithms aim at extracting the target disparity map from 2.5D space.
5. (optional) PixelNet is used as a post-refinement step for bad pixel handling.
